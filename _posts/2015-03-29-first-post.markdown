Hello there, welcome! As this is my first blog, I'd like to lay some ground rules for myself.

First, this blog will focus mainly on my projects and events I'm currently involved in. Opinions will be kept to a minimum.

Second, there will be a good amount of code snippets here. I'm a strong believer in sharing code and will be doing as much as I can.

Third, there will be a solid open-door policy. Everyone who has some criticism of my content is free to voice their concerns over email.

Well, that's about it. I'll leave a little snippet, here, to welcome myself to blogging.

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, Blogging World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

{% endhighlight %}
